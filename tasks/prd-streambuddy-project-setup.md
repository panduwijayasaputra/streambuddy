# Product Requirements Document: StreamBuddy Project Setup

## Introduction/Overview

The StreamBuddy Project Setup provides a comprehensive development environment and project structure for Indonesian gaming AI co-host application. This setup establishes a monorepo with Next.js frontend, NestJS backend, PostgreSQL database, and all necessary integrations for real-time chat processing, AI responses, and streaming platform support. The setup ensures junior developers can quickly get started and contribute to the StreamBuddy ecosystem.

## Goals

1. Create a fully functional monorepo development environment for StreamBuddy
2. Set up frontend (Next.js 14+) and backend (NestJS) with proper TypeScript configuration
3. Configure PostgreSQL database with proper entities and migrations
4. Integrate OpenAI API, Redis caching, and WebSocket connections
5. Establish comprehensive testing, linting, and code quality standards
6. Provide clear documentation and onboarding for junior developers
7. Support local development environment with all necessary services
8. Ensure proper environment configuration and secrets management

## User Stories

1. **As a junior developer**, I want to clone the repository and run the project locally in under 30 minutes so that I can start contributing immediately.

2. **As a developer**, I want clear setup instructions and documentation so that I can understand the project structure and development workflow.

3. **As a developer**, I want proper TypeScript configuration and linting so that I can write clean, maintainable code.

4. **As a developer**, I want comprehensive testing setup so that I can ensure my code works correctly before submitting.

5. **As a developer**, I want proper environment configuration so that I can work with API keys and database connections securely.

6. **As a developer**, I want the frontend and backend to communicate properly so that I can develop full-stack features.

7. **As a developer**, I want proper database setup and seeding so that I can work with realistic data during development.

8. **As a developer**, I want all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSocket) to work together so that I can test the complete StreamBuddy pipeline.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Monorepo Configuration**

   - Set up npm/yarn workspaces for apps/frontend and apps/backend
   - Configure shared packages in packages/shared
   - Set up root package.json with workspace scripts
   - Configure TypeScript paths and module resolution
   - Set up proper build and development scripts

2. **Frontend Setup (Next.js 14+)**

   - Initialize Next.js application with TypeScript
   - Configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
   - Set up StreamBuddy branding and color scheme
   - Configure environment variables for API connections
   - Set up WebSocket client for real-time communication
   - Configure proper routing and page structure

3. **Backend Setup (NestJS)**

   - Initialize NestJS application with TypeScript
   - Configure PostgreSQL with TypeORM entities
   - Set up Redis caching service
   - Configure OpenAI API integration
   - Set up WebSocket gateway for real-time chat
   - Configure proper error handling and logging

4. **Database Configuration**

   - Set up PostgreSQL database with proper schema
   - Create TypeORM entities for all StreamBuddy data models
   - Configure database migrations and seeding
   - Set up connection pooling and optimization
   - Configure backup and recovery procedures

5. **Environment and Configuration**

   - Set up environment variables for all services
   - Configure API keys and secrets management
   - Set up different environments (development, staging, production)
   - Configure proper logging and monitoring
   - Set up health checks for all services

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**

   - Configure Jest for unit and integration testing
   - Set up E2E testing with Playwright or similar
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for code validation
   - Configure test coverage reporting

7. **Documentation and Onboarding**

   - Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
   - Document API endpoints and data models
   - Provide development guidelines and coding standards
   - Create deployment guides for different environments
   - Set up API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

8. **Development Workflow**
   - Configure Git hooks and branching strategy
   - Set up development scripts for common tasks
   - Configure hot reloading for both frontend and backend
   - Set up debugging and profiling tools
   - Configure proper error reporting and monitoring

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Production deployment automation (handled separately)
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline setup (basic GitHub Actions only)
- Multi-cloud deployment configuration
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- Complex infrastructure as code (Terraform, etc.)

## Design Considerations

- **Monorepo Structure**: Clear separation between apps and shared packages
- **TypeScript First**: Strict TypeScript configuration throughout
- **StreamBuddy Branding**: Consistent color scheme and design system
- **Developer Experience**: Fast setup, clear documentation, good tooling
- **Scalability**: Architecture that supports future growth
- **Security**: Proper secrets management and environment configuration

## Technical Considerations

- **Node.js Version**: Support for Node.js 18+ LTS
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn with workspace support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with TypeORM
- **Caching**: Redis for session and response caching
- **API Integration**: OpenAI API with rate limiting
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for chat processing
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode

## Success Metrics

1. **Setup Time**: Junior developers can run project locally in under 30 minutes
2. **Documentation**: All setup steps are clearly documented and tested
3. **Code Quality**: 100% TypeScript coverage with strict mode enabled
4. **Testing**: All tests pass and coverage is above 80%
5. **Integration**: Frontend and backend communicate properly
6. **Performance**: Development environment starts in under 60 seconds
7. **Reliability**: All services (DB, Redis, WebSocket) work together
8. **Security**: No hardcoded secrets and proper environment management

## Open Questions

1. Should we include Docker setup for consistent development environments?
2. What level of database seeding should be included for development?
3. Should we set up different configurations for different developer skill levels?
4. How should we handle API rate limiting during development?
5. What backup and recovery procedures should be included in the setup?
