# Product Requirements Document: StreamBuddy Overlay

## Introduction/Overview

The StreamBuddy Overlay is a browser-based component designed to display AI-generated responses and gaming information directly on stream for viewers to see. This overlay integrates seamlessly with OBS, Streamlabs, and other streaming software to show StreamBuddy's responses in an engaging, visually appealing manner that enhances the viewing experience.

## Goals

1. Display StreamBuddy AI responses in real-time on stream for viewer engagement
2. Provide visually appealing animations and transitions for StreamBuddy responses
3. Ensure compatibility with major streaming software (OBS, Streamlabs, etc.)
4. Support customizable positioning and styling for different stream layouts
5. Maintain high performance and low resource usage during live streams

## User Stories

1. **As a streamer**, I want StreamBuddy responses to appear on my stream so that viewers can see the AI interactions and feel more engaged.

2. **As a viewer**, I want to see StreamBuddy's responses clearly and attractively so that I can understand what the AI is saying and feel part of the interaction.

3. **As a streamer**, I want to customize the overlay appearance so that it matches my stream's visual style and branding.

4. **As a streamer**, I want the overlay to be lightweight so that it doesn't impact my stream performance or game FPS.

5. **As a streamer**, I want to control when StreamBuddy responses appear so that I can manage the flow of my stream content.
